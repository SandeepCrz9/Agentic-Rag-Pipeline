# 🧠 Agentic RAG with LangChain & LlamaIndex

This project demonstrates an intermediate-level **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that combines the strengths of **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** to build a context-aware AI assistant capable of retrieving, reasoning, and answering questions using external documents.

> ✅ Built for learners and professionals aiming to explore agent-based architectures without heavyweight orchestration tools.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Uses **LangChain agents** for task orchestration  
- ✅ Embeds and indexes data using **LlamaIndex**  
- ✅ Performs document-based reasoning through **tool-calling agents**  
- ✅ Supports natural language queries with semantic retrieval  
- ✅ Clean, modular implementation via Notebook

---

## 🔍 Use Case

The notebook creates an intelligent agent that:
- Accepts user questions in natural language
- Uses document retrieval (RAG) to fetch relevant context
- Decides when to retrieve vs. respond directly
- Combines results into informative answers

---

## 🧪 Sample Tasks

- Question Answering from uploaded `.txt` or `.pdf` documents
- Agent reasoning when additional retrieval is needed
- Tool-based interaction powered by LangChain

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **LangChain** – Agent & tool management  
- **LlamaIndex** – Document ingestion & indexing  
- **Google Gemini** – LLM backend (e.g., gemini-2.0-flash)  
- **Python** – Core scripting and logic  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive execution
